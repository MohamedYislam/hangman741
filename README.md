# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it within a certain number of attempts. This implementation allows you to play against the computer, which randomly selects a word for you to guess.

## Description

This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. The computer randomly chooses a word from a predefined list, and the user tries to guess it one letter at a time. The aim of the project is to offer a fun and interactive way to engage with the traditional Hangman game while practicing and demonstrating basic Python programming concepts.

## Installation

To play this version of Hangman, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
4. Run the `hangman.py` script using Python.

## Usage

To start the game:

1. Execute the `hangman.py` file with Python.
2. The game will prompt you to guess a letter.
3. Enter your guesses one letter at a time.
4. The game provides feedback on whether your guess is in the word.

## File Structure

The project directory includes:

- `hangman.py`: The main script that runs the Hangman game.
- `README.md`: Documentation file (this file).

## Progress and Learning

So far, the game has developed to include:
- Random word selection from a list.
- Continuous prompting for the user's guess until a valid letter is entered.
- Feedback to the user on whether their guessed letter is in the word.
- Functions to organize the code logically: `check_guess` for checking the guess, and `ask_for_input` for handling user input.

This incremental development approach helps in understanding basic Python syntax, functions, loops, and conditionals.
